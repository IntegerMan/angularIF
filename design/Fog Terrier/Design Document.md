# Fog Terrier
## Story Flow

### Prologue

The story starts in a short recurring dream that the character recognizes as a traumatic and recurring one.
Once the dream ends, the player wakes up to find something bashing on the door of the office they're trapped in.
Once the character comes to his senses, he realizes it is the family terrier - begging to be let outside.

The player goes through the chore of trying to get ready to go outside while the terrier insists on doing its thing. Eventually, the player and  the terrier go out the back door.

### The Neighborhood

Out back the player discovers that the entire neighborhood is fogged over. The dog does its business outside, while the character notices a strange figure through the fog to the east and guesses it is the burglar that has been plaguing the neighborhood recently.

The player walks down the street with the terrier, towards the source of the disturbance, hoping to get a visual description or a license plate number or information on the car in question. Instead, everything seems fine and there's nobody to be found.

A very close sound of intense lightning (without a storm or rain) shakes the area to the west. All is quiet.

The dog strains to listen and then suddenly bolts off to the west, ripping its leash out of your hands in the process.

The player now must explore the neighborhood, looking for information on where the dog  went and what's going on. They see the burglar again during this process.

The player must then track down and identify where the dog went, then find a way of getting through that area with proper tools.

The player eventually figures out that the dog chased something into the field to the west, and discovered a way of getting there himself.

### The Field

The terrier is in the field and the player frees him.

The terrier is still straining to head west and refusing to return home.

The terrier shows the player a strange charred area with a fragment of clothing nearby and a torn document from the science building and some sign of distress leading into the woods.

### The Woods

The player and terrier head back to the neighborhood via the wooded path, following the torn clothing and blood.

The player and terrier stumble upon a moose blocking the path. The terrier growls at the moose and starts to invoke its anger.

The player and terrier successfully get past the moose.

The player and terrier come across a body in the woods of a greviously wounded woman. Upon closer inspection it turns out to be the player's wife, but the same age as she was ten years ago.

The wife gives the player some background and a final objective.

#### Back Yard

A thick layer of heavy fog has transformed your backyard from an utterly mundane and ordinary place to an eerie and almost magical one.

Amber light from distant streetlights reflects off of the fog to give you more than adequate lighting despite the late hour although the dense fog prevents you from seeing more than a house or two away.  You can barely make out Providence Drive to the east, past a few fenced in yards.

The safety and warmth of your kitchen is inside to the north while the yard joins small side yards to the northeast and northwest.

#### Side Yard

Your side yard, like almost any other, is an entirely unremarkable stretch of land bridging your front yard to the north and your back yard to the south. Tall grass rests against the edge of the house, despite your best attempts at keeping it at bay with the weed whacker and the only remarkable features of the area at
all are a pair of window wells and a worn patch of grass from frequent late night walks around the house with your dog.

#### Front Yard

The familiar front yard now seems utterly alien in the thick blanket of fog surrounding the area. At least the darkness and fog conceals most of the blemishes in the paint and siding, though the tall weed-infested
grass is still able to mock your lackluster lawn care in recent years.

The streetlights hit the fog and illuminate Whateley Drive in an amber glow as it stretches out to the east and west, though fog obscures visibility to the point that you can barely see a few houses down at a time.

To the south, a familiar wooden blue door leads inside to your front hall.

### Neighborhood

#### Whateley and Moriarty

Here your street meets Moriarty Lane, the main inlet to the neighborhood. The neighborhood was originally intended to span further to the north, but the economy changed and there wasn't enough demand to justify knocking down the wooded area to the north to clear the way for the expansion of Suburbia.

A dark overgrown trail leads north into the woods and away from the street.

Moriarty Lane extends to the south while Whateley Drive and your house are to the east.

#### Whateley Drive (Near Playground)

Just a little down the street to the west of your house, this portion of the street features a number of foreclosed or otherwise vacant homes from those who were fortunate enough to have left this dying town and moved elsewhere. A few homes still have occupants, though most of these have For Sale signs in their yards. Fog obscures much, but it seems like even the vacant homes are in better shape than yours.

A poorly maintained walking path juts off from the sidewalk and continues to the south towards the playground and the old community center.

Whateley Drive continues west to the corner and towards your house to the east.

#### Whateley and Providence

The intersection of Whately and Providence is punctuated by an unfinished section of street leading off to the north. When they built the neighborhood, they clearly intended to expand it further to the north and even cleared off the land, but the small section of road has now sat for years without expansion as the nearby college shut its doors, residential demand plummeted, and people moved on.

The street corner remains and links Providence Lane to the south to your street, Whateley Drive, to the west.

Further to the south, you can barely make out the Anderson Science Building through the fog. Strange, its lights are on.
