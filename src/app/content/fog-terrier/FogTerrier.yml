  cheap demo game...?

      chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways
      south and west.

  verbs:

      The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is
      completely empty. There seems to be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.

        Taking some time, you look yourself over, finding the same old scars and blemishes you've accrued
        over the years. You don't love everything about your body, but it's yours and you're used to it.

  # The Titular Cloak of Darkness
  - key: *iCloak
    name: black velvet cloak
    verbs:
      look:
        - A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly spattered with raindrops.
          Its blackness is so deep that it almost seems to suck light from the room.
      examine:
        - The velvet cloak almost seems to have darkness woven into its very fabric. Everything about
          it is darker than it should be.
    inRoomDescription: A dark black velvet cloak rests in a heap on the floor.
    attributes:
      isWearable: true
      isWorn: true

- barCantSee: It's pitch black; you can't see a thing!
- barCantManipulate: In the dark? You could easily disturb something!
- cloakDropFail: This isn't the best place to leave a smart cloak lying around.
- messageWin: The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads...
- messageLose: The message has been carelessly trampled, making it difficult to read. You can just distinguish the words...
