  Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright lights of the Opera 
  House. It's surprising that there aren't more people about but, hey, what do you expect in a 
  cheap demo game...?

    You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering 
    chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways 
    south and west.

    The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is 
    completely empty. There seems to be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.

        The velvet cloak almost seems to have darkness woven into its very fabric. Everything about 
        it is darker than it should be.
    inRoomDescription: A dark black velvet cloak rests in a heap on the floor.

strings:
- barBlunder: Blundering around in the dark isn't a good idea!
- cloakDropFail: This isn't the best place to leave a smart cloak lying around.
- messageWin: The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads...
- messageLose: The message has been carelessly trampled, making it difficult to read. You can just distinguish the words...
