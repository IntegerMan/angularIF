  verbs:

    - |
      A thick layer of heavy fog has transformed your backyard from an utterly mundane and ordinary place to an eerie and almost magical one.
    - |
      Amber light from distant streetlights reflects off of the fog to give you more than adequate
      lighting despite the late hour although the dense fog prevents you from seeing more than a house or two away.  You can barely make out Providence
      Drive to the east, past a few fenced in yards.
    - |
      The safety and warmth of your kitchen is inside to the north while the yard joins small side yards to the northeast and northwest.

    northwest:
      goMessage: |
        You'd really rather not go to the west side yard. The neighbor's dog tends to poop there no matter how much you complain, and the
        area is effectively a minefield. The northeast side yard is much better.
    east:
      goMessage: |
        Several fenced-in yards block you from cutting through to Providence Drive. You're probably better served following the street.
    south:
      goMessage: *msgNeighborsYard
- key: *rSideyard
  name: Side Yard
  verbs:
    look: 
    - |
      Your side yard, like almost any other, is an entirely unremarkable stretch of land bridging your front
      yard to the north and your back yard to the south. Tall grass rests against the edge of the house, despite your best 
      attempts at keeping it at bay with the weed whacker and the only remarkable features of the area at
      all are a pair of window wells and a worn patch of grass from frequent late night walks around the 
      house with your dog.

      goMessage: You don't need to go into the window wells.
    inside:
      goMessage: You don't need to go into the window wells and there's no door to the house here.
- key: *rFrontyard
  name: Your Front Yard
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The familiar front yard now seems utterly alien in the thick blanket of fog surrounding the area. 
      At least the darkness and fog conceals most of the blemishes in the paint and siding, though the 
      tall weed-infested grass is still able to mock your lackluster lawn care in recent years.
    - |
      The streetlights hit the fog and illuminate Whateley Drive in an amber glow as it stretches out 
      to the east and west, though fog obscures visibility to the point that you can barely see a few 
      houses down at a time.
    - |
      To the south, a familiar wooden blue door leads inside to your front hall.

    southeast: *rSideyard
- key: *rCornerWP
  name: Corner of Whateley and Providence
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The intersection of Whateley and Providence is punctuated by an unfinished section of street 
      leading off to the north. When they built the neighborhood, they clearly intended to expand 
      it further to the north and even cleared off the land, but the small section of road has now 
      sat for years without expansion as the nearby college shut its doors, residential demand 
      plummeted, and people moved on.
    - |
      The street corner remains and links Providence Lane to the south to your street, Whateley Drive, 
      to the west.
    - |
      Further to the south, you can barely make out the Anderson Science Building through the fog. _Strange, its lights are on._

         It's so foggy out there that you probably shouldn't be walking around on such a large road. Besides; 
         there are things here needing your attention.
- key: *rMoriarty
  name: Moriarty Lane
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The fog is particularly thick here and seems to be emanating from a small creek behind the homes on the 
      west side of the street.
    - |
      You can hear sounds of trickling water from the west and the occasional whines and groans of metal 
      moving in the wind to the northeast, though you see no way of going that way directly.
    - |
      The street continues north and south while a break in the fog to the west reveals a small path to 
      the edge of the creek.

  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      This corner where your street meets the main neighborhood access road is typically fairly quiet but tonight 
      it has almost has a life of its own.
    - |
      Strange chirping and rustling noises emanate from the densely wooded area on the north side of the road, 
      in flagrant disregard to the five-year-old notice that these woods are slated to be demolished to 
      make room for more suburban homes. Apparently, when plans changed, the contractors didn't bother to collect 
      the sign.
    - |
      Moriarty Lane extends to the south while Whateley Drive and your house are to the east and dark, twisty, 
      overgrown trail leads north into the woods and away from the street.

  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Just a little down the street to the west of your house, this portion of the street features a number of foreclosed or otherwise vacant homes 
      from those who were fortunate enough to have left this dying town and moved elsewhere. A few homes still have occupants, though most of these 
      have For Sale signs in their yards. Fog obscures much, but it seems like even the vacant homes are in better shape than yours.
    - |
      A poorly maintained walking path juts off from the sidewalk and continues to the south towards the playground and the old community center.
    - |
      Whateley Drive continues west to the corner and towards your house to the east.

  verbs:

        Taking some time, you look yourself over, finding the same old scars and blemishes you've accrued
        over the years. You don't love everything about your body, but it's yours and you're used to it.
