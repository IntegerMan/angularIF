- key: *rPool
  name: Pool
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      A vast billowing tarp covers the outdoor pool behind the community center, keeping external debris mostly out and protecting 
      the empty pool in case times change and people suddenly want to live in this area again. More likely, the tarp protects 
      various people from potential legal issues should anyone somehow manage to fall into the pool and hurt themselves. From the 
      rancid smells of mildew coming from the pool, you suspect the tarp is not entirely successful in keeping out rain water.
    - |
      Empty pool chairs and side tables line the sides of the pool and a small box for towels rests near the entrance to the pool.
    - |
      The tarp flaps in the breeze, making sounds almost like those of sails on a boat as it flutters. You’d never noticed before, 
      but between the flapping tarp and the pervasive mist, the pool is a _very_ creepy place to hang around at night.
    - |
      A sidewalk leads south to Lebling Drive and a path goes west to the community center.

      goMessage:
       - | 
         The tarp is still on the pool, but even if it wasn't the pool was drained long ago. Besides, you have better things 
         to do than getting hypothermia.

  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      A thick layer of heavy fog has transformed your backyard from an utterly mundane and ordinary place to an eerie and almost magical one.
    - |
      Amber light from distant streetlights reflects off of the fog to give you more than adequate
      lighting despite the late hour although the dense fog prevents you from seeing more than a house or two away.  You can barely make out Providence
      Drive to the east, past a few fenced in yards.
    - |
      The safety and warmth of your kitchen is inside to the north while the yard joins small side yards to the northeast and northwest.

    northwest:
      goMessage: |
        You'd really rather not go to the west side yard. The neighbor's dog tends to poop there no matter how much you complain, and the
        area is effectively a minefield. The northeast side yard is much better.
    east:
      goMessage: |
        Several fenced-in yards block you from cutting through to Providence Drive. You're probably better served following the street.
    south:
      goMessage: *msgNeighborsYard
- key: *rSideyard
  name: Side Yard
  verbs:
    look: 
    - |
      Your side yard, like almost any other, is an entirely unremarkable stretch of land bridging your front
      yard to the north and your back yard to the south. Tall grass rests against the edge of the house, despite your best 
      attempts at keeping it at bay with the weed whacker and the only remarkable features of the area at
      all are a pair of window wells and a worn patch of grass from frequent late night walks around the 
      house with your dog.

    inside:
      goMessage: You don't need to go into the window wells and there's no door to the house here.
- key: *rFrontyard
  name: Your Front Yard
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The familiar front yard now seems utterly alien in the thick blanket of fog surrounding the area. 
      At least the darkness and fog conceals most of the blemishes in the paint and siding, though the 
      tall weed-infested grass is still able to mock your lackluster lawn care in recent years.
    - |
      The streetlights hit the fog and illuminate Whateley Drive in an amber glow as it stretches out 
      to the east and west, though fog obscures visibility to the point that you can barely see a few 
      houses down at a time.
    - |
      To the south, a familiar wooden blue door leads inside to your front hall.

    southeast: *rSideyard
- key: *rCornerWP
  name: Corner of Whateley and Providence
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The intersection of Whateley and Providence is punctuated by an unfinished section of street 
      leading off to the north. When they built the neighborhood, they clearly intended to expand 
      it further to the north and even cleared off the land, but the small section of road has now 
      sat for years without expansion as the nearby college shut its doors, residential demand 
      plummeted, and people moved on.
    - |
      The street corner remains and links Providence Lane to the south to your street, Whateley Drive, 
      to the west.
    - |
      Further to the south, you can barely make out the Anderson Science Building through the fog. _Strange, its lights are on._

         It's so foggy out there that you probably shouldn't be walking around on such a large road. Besides; 
         there are things here needing your attention.
- key: *rMoriarty
  name: Moriarty Lane
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The fog is particularly thick here and seems to be emanating from a small creek behind the homes on the 
      west side of the street.
    - |
      You can hear sounds of trickling water from the west and the occasional whines and groans of metal 
      moving in the wind to the northeast, though you see no way of going that way directly.
    - |
      The street continues north and south while a break in the fog to the west reveals a small path to 
      the edge of the creek.

    north: *rCornerWM
    northeast: *rPlayground
    west: *rStream

- key: *rCornerWM
  name: Corner of Whateley and Moriarty
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      This corner where your street meets the main neighborhood access road is typically fairly quiet but tonight 
      it has almost has a life of its own.
    - |
      Strange chirping and rustling noises emanate from the densely wooded area on the north side of the road, 
      in flagrant disregard to the five-year-old notice that these woods are slated to be demolished to 
      make room for more suburban homes. Apparently, when plans changed, the contractors didn't bother to collect 
      the sign.
    - |
      Moriarty Lane extends to the south while Whateley Drive and your house are to the east and dark, twisty, 
      overgrown trail leads north into the woods and away from the street.
  nav:
    north: *rWoodedTrail
    east: *rNearPlayground
    south: *rMoriarty
- key: *rNearPlayground
  name: Whateley Drive (Near Playground)
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Just a little down the street to the west of your house, this portion of the street features a number of foreclosed or otherwise vacant homes 
      from those who were fortunate enough to have left this dying town and moved elsewhere. A few homes still have occupants, though most of these 
      have For Sale signs in their yards. Fog obscures much, but it seems like even the vacant homes are in better shape than yours.
    - |
      A poorly maintained walking path juts off from the sidewalk and continues to the south towards the playground and the old community center.
    - |
      Whateley Drive continues west to the corner and towards your house to the east.
  nav:
    west: *rCornerWM
    east: *rFrontyard
    southwest: *rPlayground
- key: *rPlayground
  name: Playground
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      What was once a modest neighborhood playground by any standards has now fallen horribly into disrepair. A carousel sits here, its 
      center clearly bent and twisted so that any potential rider would have a horribly lopsided experience. Several teeter-totters are 
      also here, though their wooden beams appear to be mostly rotted and certainly wouldn’t hold you safely. Where there once was a 
      two-person swing set, there’s now only a mound of wood chips after the swing set was finally torn down when one of the support 
      beams collapsed in a particularly heavy storm a year ago.
    - |
      The smell of mold and mildew permeates the air, punctuated by the moist air from the foggy weather.
    - |
      The carousel groans and creaks in the wind.
    - |
      Paths lead out from the playground to Whateley Drive to the northeast and Moriarty Lane to the southwest. A different path runs south 
      to the community center.

    southwest: *rMoriarty
    northeast: *rNearPlayground
    south: *rCommunity
- key: *rCommunity
  name: Outside the Community Center
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The neighborhood’s community center once served as a sales and management office while the neighborhood still had plans of building 
      apartments and condominiums alongside the freestanding homes like your own. Once residential demand plummeted and plans for the 
      condos were scrapped, the management office shut down and they took the towels, exercise equipment and the rest of the community 
      center and pursued less hopeless opportunities elsewhere.
    - |
      What remains is an attractive hollow shell of a white building. Although the paint is chipped in some areas, the building still 
      manages to be appealing, even despite the boarded-up windows and doors.
    - |
      Your wife would have hated to have seen it like this. She used to love to come and exercise inside in the mornings while listening 
      to audio books.
    - |
      A notice board stands in front of the boarded-up doors. Most of the notices are faded and torn, but a few seem to have been added 
      only recently.
    - |
      A walkway stretches from the playground to the north and continues to the southwest to the street corner. A small path leads east 
      to the pool behind the community center.
  nav:
    west: *rPlayground
    north:
      goMessage: |
        The door is locked and chained shut and the lights are off inside. Besides, they cleaned out everything of 
        interest inside when the building closed down a few years ago.

        Taking some time, you look yourself over, finding the same old scars and blemishes you've accrued
        over the years. You don't love everything about your body, but it's yours and you're used to it.
