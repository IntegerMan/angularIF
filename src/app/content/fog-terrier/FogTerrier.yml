introText:

  You’re back here again. You stand before the readouts and switches yet again. You don’t remember falling asleep, 
  but nonetheless, you’ve arrived inexplicably and inevitably in the hell of your own past.
- |
  You recognize this place as the monitoring room of the Anderson Science Center - or at least your memory of it. 
  You know the real one shut down years ago, but that has never stopped you from reliving your final experiment 
  there before.
- |
  Red lights illuminate the room. They said it was to help you focus on the various dials in the low lighting 
  conditions required for the experiment in the adjoining room, but the lighting apparently wasn’t enough the 
  last time to stop things.
- |
  You bet it won’t be enough this time either.

rooms:
- key: *rPool
  name: Pool
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      A vast billowing tarp covers the outdoor pool behind the community center, keeping external debris mostly out and protecting 
      the empty pool in case times change and people suddenly want to live in this area again. More likely, the tarp protects 
      various people from potential legal issues should anyone somehow manage to fall into the pool and hurt themselves. From the 
      rancid smells of mildew coming from the pool, you suspect the tarp is not entirely successful in keeping out rain water.
    - |
      Empty pool chairs and side tables line the sides of the pool and a small box for towels rests near the entrance to the pool.
    - |
      The tarp flaps in the breeze, making sounds almost like those of sails on a boat as it flutters. You’d never noticed before, 
      but between the flapping tarp and the pervasive mist, the pool is a _very_ creepy place to hang around at night.
    - |
      A sidewalk leads south to the dense fog on Lebling Drive and a path goes west to the community center.
  nav:

      goMessage:
       - | 
         The tarp is still on the pool, but even if it wasn't the pool was drained long ago. Besides, you have better things 
         to do than getting hypothermia.

  # No navigation here
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      You are seated at a complex workstation in front of a wide variety of gauges and readouts - the kind of station that 
      would feel right at home at a power plant’s control room.
    - |
      A mug of coffee and an operations manual are the only items on the workstation that aren’t built into the workstation itself.
    - |
      A double-paned reinforced window separates the monitoring room with the experiment chamber to the north and a security 
      door leads out to the southwest.
  # Listen for 'awake' / 'wake up' / 'awaken' / 'look at clock' / disbelieve
- key: *rOffice
  name: Home Office
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Your home office was never clean by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s been worse since the accident. You tell 
      yourself that there’s a method to the madness and you know where to find anything of importance, but even you have to 
      admit that when you need to keep the dog out of a room for fear of him ripping up bank paperwork that you have issues. 
    - |
      Your desktop computer is here on the desk. It looks to be busy installing important system updates at the moment.
    - |
      A set of glass double doors leads east to your hallway.
  nav:
    east: *rHall # TODO: Cover this with a door
- key: *rHall
  name: Front Hall
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The front hall area is a narrow entry area without much adornment. Several old family pictures and plaques 
      decorate the walls.
    - |
      Aside from the pictures, the only decoration here is a coat rack on the north wall near the front door. Glass double 
      doors, currently {{doorState}}, lead west to your home office and a narrow staircase goes upstairs.
    - |
      The hall continues south to the kitchen and living room.
  nav:
    west: *rOffice # TODO: Cover this with a door
    south: *rKitchen
    north: *rFrontyard # TODO: Cover this with a lockable door
- key: *rKitchen
  name: Kitchen
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Your kitchen. Gone are the days of clean counters and tabletops, or even, to be frank, eating at the table instead of 
      in the living room. The counters and sink are filled to capacity with empty cups and plates caked with dried fried rice.
    - |
      From the smell, you forgot to take the garbage out this week.
    - |
      Your living room is to the east and the front hall lies to the north.
    - |
      A sliding door leads outside to your backyard, normally quite dark at this hour, now appears to be blanketed in a dense fog.
  nav:
    north: *rHall
    east: *rLivingRoom
    south: *rBackyard # TODO: Cover this with a lockable sliding door
- key: *rBackyard
  name: Back Yard
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      A thick layer of heavy fog has transformed your backyard from an utterly mundane and ordinary place to an eerie and almost magical one.
    - |
      Amber light from distant streetlights reflects off of the fog to give you more than adequate
      lighting despite the late hour although the dense fog prevents you from seeing more than a house or two away.  You can barely make out Providence
      Drive to the east, past a few fenced in yards.
    - |
      The safety and warmth of your kitchen is inside to the north while the yard joins small side yards to the northeast and northwest.
  nav:

    inside: *rKitchen # TODO: Cover this with a lockable sliding door
    northeast: *rSideyard
    northwest:
      goMessage: |
        You'd really rather not go to the west side yard. The neighbor's dog tends to poop there no matter how much you complain, and the
        area is effectively a minefield. The northeast side yard is much better.
    east:
      goMessage: |
        Several fenced-in yards block you from cutting through to Providence Drive. You're probably better served following the street.
    south:
      goMessage: *msgNeighborsYard
- key: *rSideyard
  name: Side Yard
  verbs:
    look: 
    - |
      Your side yard, like almost any other, is an entirely unremarkable stretch of land bridging your front
      yard to the north and your back yard to the south. Tall grass rests against the edge of the house, despite your best 
      attempts at keeping it at bay with the weed whacker and the only remarkable features of the area at
      all are a pair of window wells and a worn patch of grass from frequent late night walks around the 
      house with your dog.

    inside:
      goMessage: You don't need to go into the window wells and there's no door to the house here.
- key: *rFrontyard
  name: Your Front Yard
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The familiar front yard now seems utterly alien in the thick blanket of fog surrounding the area. 
      At least the darkness and fog conceals most of the blemishes in the paint and siding, though the 
      tall weed-infested grass is still able to mock your lackluster lawn care in recent years.
    - |
      The streetlights hit the fog and illuminate Whateley Drive in an amber glow as it stretches out 
      to the east and west, though fog obscures visibility to the point that you can barely see a few 
      houses down at a time.
    - |
      To the south, a familiar wooden blue door leads inside to your front hall.
  nav:
    west: *rNearPlayground
    east: *rCornerWP
    south: *rHall # TODO: Cover this with a lockable door
    southeast: *rSideyard
- key: *rCornerWP
  name: Corner of Whateley and Providence
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The intersection of Whateley and Providence is punctuated by an unfinished section of street 
      leading off to the north. When they built the neighborhood, they clearly intended to expand 
      it further to the north and even cleared off the land, but the small section of road has now 
      sat for years without expansion as the nearby college shut its doors, residential demand 
      plummeted, and people moved on.
    - |
      The street corner remains and links Providence Lane to the south to your street, Whateley Drive, 
      to the west.
    - |
      Further to the south, you can barely make out the Anderson Science Building through the fog. _Strange, its lights are on._      
  nav:
    west: *rFrontyard
    south: *rProvidence
- key: *rProvidence
  name: Providence Drive
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      On a normal day, Providence Lane would be an ordinary connecting street if it wasn’t for the large 
      form of the two-story Anderson Science Center on the east side of the road.
    - |
      Tonight, however, the dense fog gives the street a certain mysterious and otherworldly quality as 
      much of the details of the surrounding world are drowned out by the dense low-hanging fog.
    - |
      The fog grows thicker to the south towards the pond and the entrance to the Science Center, but 
      remains somewhat thick even to the north near your house.
    - |
      A white utility van is parked on the side of the street.
  nav:
    north: *rCornerWP
    southwest: *rFountain
    south: *rCornerLP
- key: *rCornerLP
  name: Corner of Lebling and Providence
  verbs:
    look:
    - | 
      The fog is much thicker here than it is farther to the north. That same dense fog extends to the west all along 
      Lebling Drive and seems to be coming from the small man-made pond on the south side of the road.
    - |
      Several parked cars occupy the streets but are half obscured by the dense fog.
    - |
      The main parking lot of the Science Center is accessible to the east via a small path that was built back when 
      the science center was still in business. You think back to fonder days when you and many of your former 
      neighbors would walk that path to the east on the way to work every morning. 
    - |
      Providence Lane leads to the north towards your house, following the west edge of the Anderson Science Center. 
      Lebling Drive continues westwards along the edge of the pond.
  nav:
    north: *rProvidence
    west: *rNearFountain
    east: *rParkingLot
- key: *rNearFountain
  name: Lebling Drive (Near Fountain)
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      You’re now deep inside of a large cloud of fog, likely coming from the cool water in the decorative pond to the south 
      meeting the atypically warmer air this evening. Visibility is limited to only ten feet in front of you, making it 
      difficult to recognize exactly where you are, despite your familiarity with the neighborhood.
    - |
      The street runs to the east and west and you remember a path heading northeast to a small decorative park with a fountain.

  nav:
    northeast: *rFountain
    east: *rCornerLP
    west: *rNearPool
- key: *rFountain
  name: Fountain
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The fog is incredibly thick in this area and you can barely make out the silhouette of the stone fountain in the middle of 
      a small decorative area. What once was an attractive and lively decoration punctuating some very cozy-looking condominium 
      units and apartments now seems somehow ominous and alien, like a strange artifact of ages past jutting out from the ground 
      in monolithic grandeur.
    - |
      The fountain appears to still be operational, with trickles of water active in its surface and a steady mist billowing out 
      of it as the colder water meets the warmer air. You guess that it’s still slightly too early in the year for water to the 
      fountains to be shut down for the winter.
    - |
      A decorative gravel path leads from the northeast to the southwest.
  nav:
    northeast: *rProvidence
    west: *rNearFountain
- key: *rNearPool
  name: Lebling Drive (Near Pool)
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      You are at the edge of a sea of fog and mist near the west end of Lebling Drive at the south end of the neighborhood. The 
      fog is so thick that you can barely see more than fifteen feet in front of you.
    - |
      Small homes line the north side of the street, overlooking a small man-made pond immediately to the south. The fog over the 
      pond is so thick you can’t even see the fountains that keep the water churning to prevent the ponds from becoming a sea of algae.
    - |
      You hear a rhythmic sound of something large moving in the breeze to the north. Although you can barely see it, you 
      remember that a small path wedged between two homes goes that way to the pool behind the community center. 
    - |
      The fog eases off to the west and the street continues to the east.
  nav:
    north: *rPool
    east: *rNearFountain
    west: *rCornerLM
- key: *rCornerLM
  name: Corner of Lebling and Moriarty
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The intersection of Lebling and Moriarty seems almost like a valley between two massive pockets of heavy fog - one further 
      to the north up Moriarty near the stream, and the other to the east, likely from the small pond on Lebling Drive.
    - |
      Moriarty Lane leads south to the main road or north towards your house. Lebling Drive continues to the east of here.
  nav:
    north: *rMoriarty
    east: *rNearPool
    south: *rNeighborhoodEntrance
- key: *rNeighborhoodEntrance
  name: Entrance to Neighborhood
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Here Moriarty Lane meets Ravenwood Avenue, the major street connecting to the neighborhood. Initial plans for the 
      neighborhood had it expanding to meet Holybrook far to the north, but the expansion was cancelled and Ravenwood 
      remains the only lifeline to this slowly decaying portion of suburbia.
    - |
      A wooden sign welcoming visitors to the neighborhood is overshadowed by a massive cloud of fog looming to the east over 
      the pond bordering the neighborhood and obscures much of your view of Lebling Drive to the northeast.
    - |
      One of the houses in this area must still be occupied as its yard is decorated with all sorts of Halloween decorations, 
      despite it still being early October.
    - |
      Moriarty Lane leads to the north.
  nav:
    north: *rCornerLM
    south:
      goMessage:
       - | 
         It's so foggy out there that you probably shouldn't be walking around on such a large road. Besides; 
         there are things here needing your attention.
- key: *rMoriarty
  name: Moriarty Lane
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The fog is particularly thick here and seems to be emanating from a small creek behind the homes on the 
      west side of the street.
    - |
      You can hear sounds of trickling water from the west and the occasional whines and groans of metal 
      moving in the wind to the northeast, though you see no way of going that way directly.
    - |
      The street continues north and south while a break in the fog to the west reveals a small path to 
      the edge of the creek. 
  nav:
    north: *rCornerWM
    northeast: *rPlayground
    west: *rStream
    south: *rCornerLM

  name: Corner of Whateley and Moriarty
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      This corner where your street meets the main neighborhood access road is typically fairly quiet but tonight 
      it has almost has a life of its own.
    - |
      Strange chirping and rustling noises emanate from the densely wooded area on the north side of the road, 
      in flagrant disregard to the five-year-old notice that these woods are slated to be demolished to 
      make room for more suburban homes. Apparently, when plans changed, the contractors didn't bother to collect 
      the sign.
    - |
      Moriarty Lane extends to the south while Whateley Drive and your house are to the east and dark, twisty, 
      overgrown trail leads north into the woods and away from the street.
  nav:
    north: *rWoodedTrail
    east: *rNearPlayground
    south: *rMoriarty
- key: *rNearPlayground
  name: Whateley Drive (Near Playground)
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      Just a little down the street to the west of your house, this portion of the street features a number of foreclosed or otherwise vacant homes 
      from those who were fortunate enough to have left this dying town and moved elsewhere. A few homes still have occupants, though most of these 
      have For Sale signs in their yards. Fog obscures much, but it seems like even the vacant homes are in better shape than yours.
    - |
      A poorly maintained walking path juts off from the sidewalk and continues to the south towards the playground and the old community center.
    - |
      Whateley Drive continues west to the corner and towards your house to the east.
  nav:
    west: *rCornerWM
    east: *rFrontyard
    southwest: *rPlayground
- key: *rPlayground
  name: Playground
  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      What was once a modest neighborhood playground by any standards has now fallen horribly into disrepair. A carousel sits here, its 
      center clearly bent and twisted so that any potential rider would have a horribly lopsided experience. Several teeter-totters are 
      also here, though their wooden beams appear to be mostly rotted and certainly wouldn’t hold you safely. Where there once was a 
      two-person swing set, there’s now only a mound of wood chips after the swing set was finally torn down when one of the support 
      beams collapsed in a particularly heavy storm a year ago.
    - |
      The smell of mold and mildew permeates the air, punctuated by the moist air from the foggy weather.
    - |
      The carousel groans and creaks in the wind.
    - |
      Paths lead out from the playground to Whateley Drive to the northeast and Moriarty Lane to the southwest. A different path runs south 
      to the community center.
  nav:
    southwest: *rMoriarty
    northeast: *rNearPlayground

  verbs:
    look:
    - |
      The neighborhood’s community center once served as a sales and management office while the neighborhood still had plans of building 
      apartments and condominiums alongside the freestanding homes like your own. Once residential demand plummeted and plans for the 
      condos were scrapped, the management office shut down and they took the towels, exercise equipment and the rest of the community 
      center and pursued less hopeless opportunities elsewhere.
    - |
      What remains is an attractive hollow shell of a white building. Although the paint is chipped in some areas, the building still 
      manages to be appealing, even despite the boarded-up windows and doors.
    - |
      Your wife would have hated to have seen it like this. She used to love to come and exercise inside in the mornings while listening 
      to audio books.
    - |
      A notice board stands in front of the boarded-up doors. Most of the notices are faded and torn, but a few seem to have been added 
      only recently.
    - |
      A walkway stretches from the playground to the north and continues to the southwest to the street corner. A small path leads east 
      to the pool behind the community center.

        Taking some time, you look yourself over, finding the same old scars and blemishes you've accrued
        over the years. You don't love everything about your body, but it's yours and you're used to it.
