# Fog Terrier
## Story Flow
The story starts in a short recurring dream that the character recognizes as a traumatic and recurring one.
Once the dream ends, the player wakes up to find something bashing on the door of the office they're trapped in.
Once the character comes to his senses, he realizes it is the family terrier - begging to be let outside.

The player goes through the chore of trying to get ready to go outside while the terrier insists on doing its thing. Eventually, the player and  the terrier go out the back door.

Out back the player discovers that the entire neighborhood is fogged over. The dog does its business outside, while the character notices a strange figure through the fog to the east and guesses it is the burglar that has been plaguing the neighborhood recently.

The player walks down the street with the terrier, towards the source of the disturbance, hoping to get a visual description or a license plate number or information on the car in question. Instead, everything seems fine and there's nobody to be found.

A very close sound of intense lightning (without a storm or rain) shakes the area to the west. All is quiet.

The dog strains to listen and then suddenly bolts off to the west, ripping its leash out of your hands in the process.

The player now must explore the neighborhood, looking for information on where the dog  went and what's going on. They see the burglar again during this process.
